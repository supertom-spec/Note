*** Overview
**** Proof Assistants
- *Automated theorem provers provide "push-button" operation*: SAT solvers, SMT
  solvers, and model checkers.
- *Proof assistants*: Isabelle, Agda, ACL2, PVS, Coq.

Coq:
+ As a platform for modeling programming languages
+ As an environment for developing formally certified software and hardware
  - /CompCert/: a fully-verified optimizing compiler for C
  - /CertiKOS/: a fuuly verifed hypervisor, for proving the correctness of
    subtle algorithms involving floating point numbers.
  - /CertiCrypt/: an environment for reasoning about the security of
    cryptographic algorithms.
  - also being used to build verified implementations of the open-source
    /RISC-V/ processor architecture.
+ As a realistic environment for functional programming with dependent types:
  e.g. Ynot sytem embeds "relational Hoare reasoning"
+ As a proof assistant for higher-order logic: 4-color theorem, Felt-Thompson
  Theorem's of classification of finite simple groups.
